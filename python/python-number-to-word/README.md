# Number to Words Converter

## Description
This program converts numbers from 0 to 999 into their English word representation.

## Why This Project?
This project was my entry point into Python programming. I chose it to solve a simple but logic-based problem, which helped me understand how to break down problems and convert numerical input into meaningful output.

The goal of the project is to practice logical thinking, dictionaries, and conditional
statements using a clear and step-by-step approach.

## How It Works
- The user enters a number
- The program checks the length of the number
- Each part of the number (ones, tens, hundreds) is processed separately
- The final result is printed as words

## Features
- Supports numbers from 0 to 999
- Handles special cases (11–19)
- Uses dictionaries for clarity

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python fundamentals
- Dictionaries
- Functions
- String handling
- Conditional logic

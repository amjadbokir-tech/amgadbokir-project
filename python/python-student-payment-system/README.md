# Student Meal Payment System

## Description
A simple system that manages student meal payments using basic object-oriented programming.

Each student has a balance, and meals are deducted based on selection.

## Why This Project?
This project was created to address a real problem I face in the student dormitory where I live. The existing meal payment system is inefficient and unclear, so I built a simple program to simulate a more organized and understandable solution for managing student balances and meal payments.


## Meal Prices
- Breakfast: 200
- Lunch: 500
- Dinner: 250

## Features
- Add a student with initial balance
- Buy meals and deduct balance
- Display balance before and after purchase
- Student inquiry showing meals taken
- Monthly report for all students

## Skills Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and methods
- Basic system design
- User input handling

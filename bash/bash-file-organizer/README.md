# File Organizer by Extension

## Description
A Bash script that organizes files in the home directory based on their extensions.

The script processes files only and ignores directories.

## Why This Project?
This project was created to solve the problem of file clutter while using Linux in a virtual environment. Organizing files manually was time-consuming, so this script automates the process and keeps directories clean and structured.

## How It Works
- Scans files in the home directory
- Creates a main folder:
  ~/folder-extension
- Creates one folder per extension
- Moves files to their corresponding folders
- Files without extension are moved to:
  no-extension

## Features
- Ignores directories
- Handles files without extensions
- Automatic folder creation

## Skills Demonstrated
- File system operations
- Loops and conditions
- String manipulation
- Bash scripting fundamentals
